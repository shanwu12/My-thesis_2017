车载组合导航是现代智能车辆必不可少的一项重要功能。为满足自动辅助驾驶系统对小型化低成本低功耗导航系统的需求，本课题针对微电子机械系统(MEMS)惯性传感器和卫星导航模块，完成了小型化MEMS惯导/GNSS组合导航模块的设计。

本文着重理解分析了组合定位的基本原理，确定采用位置/速度级的松组合导航算法，建立MEMS惯导姿态、速度和位置误差模型，并推导了卡尔曼滤波的状态方程和观测方程，完成导航系统数据的信息融合。整个系统设计主要可以分成硬件设计和软件设计。主要研究内容如下：

1、模块以ARM微处理器、MEMS惯性器件、卫星定位模块中等为主要组成部分，详细给出系统硬件体系结构和具体的硬件选型及接口设计，完成硬件原理图和电路板制作，并进行硬件调试。

2、在硬件实验平台的基础上，给出了软件设计流程图，并编写软件底层驱动程序和导航应用程序，实现多传感器通信，组合系统数据的融合解算、导航信息的存储等功能。

3、设计了MEMS惯导/GNSS组合系统的实时监控界面，实现对数据的保存，模式选择、数据加载、轨迹显示等功能，可以直观地显示车辆的运行状态，具有很强的工程应用性。

最后，对设计的组合导航模块进行车载实验，结果表明本设计的MEMS惯导/GNSS组合系统完成了实时导航系统的基本功能，且位置误差约$5\sim7m$，速度误差约$0.2\sim0.5m/s$，姿态误差约为$8^\circ$，满足车载组合系统小型化、低成本和实时性的设计要求。
